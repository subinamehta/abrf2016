# ABRF2018

[Workshop at ABRF 2016 SW2] (https://conf.abrf.org/sw2-galaxy-platform-accessible-core-laboratory-solution-proteogenomic-analysis-and-informatics)

**(SW2) The Galaxy Platform as an Accessible, Core Laboratory Solution for Proteogenomic Analysis and Informatics**
**Sunday, April 22, 2018 (8:00am-12:00pm)**

**Organizers**: Pratik Jagtap and Tim Griffin, University of Minnesota

**Instructors**: Tim Griffin, Pratik Jagtap and Praveen Kumar

This workshop 

Workshop goals:

- Introduce the Galaxy framework as a solution for data analysis across ‘omics’ domains
- Provide hands-on experience to attendees in using Galaxy
- Demonstrate use of Galaxy for a proteogenomic analysis (RNA-seq and proteomic integrative analysis)
- Lay the foundation for attendees to implement Galaxy at their own facility or institution to meet ‘omics’ data analysis needs (either specific to one domain or for multi-omics)
